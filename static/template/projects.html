<p>
Wintermute is the work done by The Synthetic Intellect Institute to implement the world's first personal edition of an intelligent framework of applications and libraries, and in the future, an intelligent operating system. This is the brainchild of the SII. Wintermute bolsters the capabilities of using neural networking to learn about its host, a pseudo-langauge engine that permits translations and grammar rulesets of any language to be incorporated into the system, and database downloads of different sets of data to permit the combination of the world's first personal virtual self-thinking assistant. It can be used to perform simple tasks like dictation to a favorite word editor to more complex tasks, like sorting documents depending on the time of day, or automation of other routinely tasks that one would need.

<p>
SpeechControl isn't your average Linux application. Based on the ever-prominent library systems, Qt and Boost, and using the well-known speech recognition tool PocketSphinx, SpeechControl provides you with the ability to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Training: SpeechControl allows you to train and build archives of your voice so that the speech recognition can understand your voice to precision.</li>
<li>Adapting: SpeechControl can install standard models and adapt the model to reduce the amount of work you'd have to do and have a wider range of accuracy.</li>
<li>Cloud-Sourcing:SpeechControl can send your training information to an online repository known as VoxForge, the haven for open source speech recognition models.</li>
</ul>
